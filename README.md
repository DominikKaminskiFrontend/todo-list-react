## Project Idea  
  
Project idea is to creat simple to do list by using learned konwlage about HTML, CSS, JS and React in actual project.  
  
**! After refresh all task will be reseted (for now!)**  
  
If you want to add task, simply write it down in the input place then hit enter or side button (_Dodaj zadanie_)    
After you do that, Added task will show itself on the list bellow.  
Now You can mark task as done by hitting green squere üü© on left side of task, notice that after You click on it, there will be tic mark added(‚úîÔ∏è) inside green squere, and task information will be crossed.
If You want to remove task from list, simply hit red button on the right side with bin in it!\
Now, in React u can write HTML elements in tasks- it will be added as text to task! 
  
**If u want, you can write long task!**

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
